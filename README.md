A Web Application - University Project on crowd sourcing data for the detection and prevention of Covid-19 by monitoring the traffic in local shops.

The platform allows users to search for stores from a database, report their presence timestamp to the website and declare if they receive a positive diagnosis, to inform other users and stores.
The interactive heat map enables users to click on store markers, revealing real-time and estimated traffic.
